# Starship configuration file for customizing the shell prompt in the terminal.
# Based on Chris Titus's configuration: https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/mybash/tree/main
# This TOML file defines the overall format of the prompt, using a series of modules
# separated by powerline-style symbols (e.g., , , ) with custom background and foreground colors.
# Each module (like $python, $directory) displays relevant information if available.
# Colors are defined in hex format (e.g., #3B4252 for Nord theme-inspired palette).
# The format is a multi-line string that concatenates these elements.

# The 'format' key defines the prompt layout as a string with embedded modules and separators.
# It starts with a left-rounded corner [] in color #84926a, followed by OS logo, username on hostname.
# Transitions to next sections with [] separators, changing background colors for visual distinction.
# Includes directory, time, command duration with status indicator.
# Modules are placeholders that Starship replaces with actual data based on the current environment.

# "Important Documents" = "  "

# So either put "Important Documents" before "Documents" or use the substituted version:
